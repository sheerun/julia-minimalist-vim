If you're looking for vim syntax highilight for Julia, you should first try the
official [julia-vim](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia-vim) repository.

This is the alternate syntax definition that I use when hacking Julia, which is
less complete, but much simpler, faster, and works with [rainbow
parenthesis](https://github.com/kien/rainbow_parentheses.vim).

This bundle contributes to [vim-polyglot](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot) language pack.
